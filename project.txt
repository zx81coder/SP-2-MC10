PROJECT : A TRS8 MC10 emulator on the ZX Spectrum

My first computer was not a ZX Spectrum but a TRS80 MC10.

A few years ago I coded my very first machinecode game for that computer.
After porting my SHOGUN game from the ZX Spectrum to the ZX81 and 
the Videopac gameconsole I coded this game on the TRS80 MC10.

Like my ZX81 emulator from 1997 and my Videopac emulator from 2000
it seems almost impossible to make it a decent emulator.

The following problems might occur:
- speed
The Motorola MC6803 has a clockspeed of .79Mhz but the opcodes are faster
than a Z80. Moreover you need to translate the opcodes to run as Z80-code.

- memory
The MC10 has a whole different memory layout from any Z80 computer.
#0000 	#00FF	zeropage RAM memory
#4000 	#nnnn	RAM memory (depending on RAMpack how much RAM) starting with screen
#E000	#FFFF ROM memory

On a ZX Spectrum the memory is :
#0000	#3FFF	ROM
#4000	#5AFF	Screen
#5B00	#5CCB	Systemvariables
#5CCC	#FFFF	RAM for BASIC or machinecode

A large part of the code can therefore not run at its own addressses. 
To make a working emulator the MC10-memory is stored at the following addressses.

#8000	zeropage
#C000	RAM
#BFFF	keyboarddata
#E000	ROM

RAM is therefore dislocated from the real address, but each address in both ROM and RAM can be found
by setting bit 7 of the address. That is how the emulator works.

- the coloursettings:
I have to make a bit different settings
TRS80       black - green       - beige         - blue 
ZX Spectrum black - green       - bright yellow - blue 

TRS80       red   - white       - cyan     - magenta - orange
ZX Spectrum red   - brightwhite - cyan     - magenta - yellow

- sound
This is the first emulator I write with colour and sound.
I made a soundroutine that is not perfect, but it works

- screen
A character on the screen is 8x12. 2 characters with different colours 
can give colourclash. To solve this I made each character 8x8.

- Reading keyboard
Keyboard is different from ZX Spectrum
The keyboard is scanned each time a value is written to #0002.
The emulator must scan the keyboard then. The keyboard on the MC10 has 48 keys,
the ZX Spectrum has 40 keys. 


- flags
The MC10 has flags that are not on the Z80.
The overflowflag is emulated by checking 2 flags.
